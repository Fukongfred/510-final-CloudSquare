## Problems trying to solve
In a world where rapid modern life often confines 
us to structured environments, our interaction 
with the natural world diminishes. 

One of the overlooked elements is the artistry of 
cloud formations. These natural wonders not only 
offer aesthetic pleasure but also hold educational 
value, yet they remain unappreciated due to our 
indoor-oriented lifestyles and screen-focused 
attention.

This project specifically targets urban dwellers, 
particularly families with children and educators, 
who are seeking meaningful ways to reconnect 
with nature and enhance learning through 
innovative technology.

## How to run
```
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Reflections
It's essential to first decide what kind of app you want to create and where you plan to deploy it. Frankly, the current components in Streamlit can't fully meet our initial UX/UI expectations for the app. Therefore, if possible, it would be beneficial to start by learning more flexible and foundational methods for building UI, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Alternatively, for iOS development, learning Swift and Objective-C, and for Android development, Java or Kotlin would be advantageous.

## What you learned
How to coordinate and deploy various app functionalities between the frontend and backend. How to quickly write and debug frontend and backend code with the help of GPT-4.

## What questions/problems did you face?
Finding model resources can be somewhat challenging. Some technical terms and concepts are difficult to understand, which affects my usage. However, after understanding the technical logic, we can resolve most issues with the help of GPT-4. If there are still unresolved issues, we can schedule a meeting with Ian, haha.
